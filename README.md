# REPORT 
## 1. Introduction:

•	This report covers the setup for six utility functions in part A. 
•	It also includes two games for part B. 
•	You get the complete Python code for everything. 
•	There are short notes on the logic behind each one. 
•	Input checks are explained, too.
•

## 2. Part A: Python Functions:
•	The program runs from the command line. 
•	It shows a menu so you can pick from the six functions. 
•	It keeps going until you choose to quit.

### 2.1 Perfect Number Sum Calculator:
•	The perfect number sum calculator comes first. 
•	It adds up all perfect numbers in a range you set. 
•	The range includes both ends. 
•	It makes sure the inputs are integers before doing anything.

 
### 2.2 Weight Unit Converter:
•	Next is the weight unit converter. 
•	It switches between kilograms and pounds. 
•	You enter K to go from kg to lb. 
•	Or P for the other way. 
•	If you pick wrong, it gives an error message. 

 

### 2.3 Vowel Counter:
•	The vowel counter tallies up "a e i o u” in any string you give it. 
•	It does not care about upper or lower case.


### 2.4 Average and Range Finder:
•	It figures the average for a list of numbers. 
•	Also, the range is max minus min. 
•	It throws an error if the list is empty or contains no numbers.

 

### 2.5 String Reverser with Word Count
•	It flips the whole string around. 
•	It counts words, too. 
•	It ignores extra spaces between them.

 
### 2.6 Specific Word Counter
•	It looks for “is, are, has, have” in a file called File.txt. 
•	The file is local.
•	If the file is not there, it just returns zeros for everything. 

 
## 3. Part B: Games
•	It has two games. 
•	Both use text inputs. 
•	They check what you type.
•	It provides clear feedback.

### 3.1 Guess the Number:
•	A random number is generated from 1 to 100. 
•	You need to guess the number.
•	It has to be a number, or it shows an error. 
•	Hints are provided to tell you whether it is higher or lower. 
•	It counts your tries. 
•	It stops when you get the number right.

### 3.2 Rock Paper Scissors Game
•	You play against the computer. 
•	The computer picks its stand randomly.
•	The user enters rock, paper, or scissors. 
•	It checks if it is a valid input or not. 
•	Keeps score for wins and losses. 
•	When you exit, it sums up the final scores and gives you the output.
 

## 4. Summary:
•	All the menu options get checked. 
•	It rejects bad numbers or weird strings. 
•	Conversions for numbers round off properly. 
•	Errors for empty lists or no File.txt are handled nicely. 
•	Prompts stay clear.

## 5. Conclusion:
The whole thing wraps up with solid input handling. The output format is clean. Code stays modular for functions and games. The menu makes testing easy. You can demo it without hassle.
